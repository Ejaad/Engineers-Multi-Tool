# Engineers-Multi-Tool
yet another tool for electronics engineers to use on their workbench - planned to include Voltmeter, Ammeter, Component Tester, Serial Terminal, DAQ functionality, Waveform Generator.

A basic Arduino nano based portable device, having portable power, a basic display and circuitry to measure voltage, current, pulses, test components (Resistors, Capacitors, Transistors and more) and also be able to serve as a Serial Terminal and MORE.

## Planned Features
* Handheld formfactor - credit card/gameboy/mobile phone sized
* Arduino based
* Input Push Buttons - 6 to 10 buttons via 1 single ADC pin
* Nokia Graphics LCD - Mono, Mobile LCD for Display
* Voltage Input - 0 to 50V or possibly, -50 to 50V Voltmeter (2x)
* Current Input - 0 to 500mA or even possibly 1A Ammeter (FUSED)
* Serial Terminal - Show incoming Serial data on screen (adjustable/auto baudrate)
* Sqaure Wave Generator - basic clock generator, upto 1MHz with adjustable Duty Cycle
* Pulse Counter - Basic Pulse stats - Freq, Duty Cycle, etc
* Component Tester - a variant of the SemiConductor Tester
* Battery Powered - Chargeable via USB
* Serial Connection with PC - A basic data acquisition app on PC Side - Windows/Linux

### Suggest any other ideas that could be done..!


## TODO
* Upload Schematic
* Battery Charger integration
* Serial Terminal implementation
* Write more TODO List items...!


## WORK LOG
* Basic Circuit made on a protoboard
* LCD and Buttons Tested
* Simple Voltmeter 0.5 to 50V implemented
* Simple Pulse Generator Implemented with adjustable Freq/Duty
* Simple Menu interface implemented
* Integrate the Voltmeter, Pulse generator and Menu in one code
> DONE before 10th of June 2015
